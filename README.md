# Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system from scratch

This repository consist of full source code of Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system from scratch. The method originally described in [1]. It does not depend on Matlab toolbox. every single details were coded in Matlab. You can compare our result by Matlab toolbox's equivalent results. We also provided two different demo, one for 3 input one output train data, one for 216 elements, 3 input , 1 output data. Second demo is for 121 element, 2 inputs, 1 output data.

In demo1, we used 2 fuzzy set for representing the inputs. Here is the results of Demo1.m script.

In demo2, we used 4 fuzzy set for representing the inputs. Here is the results of Demo2.m script.
